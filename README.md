# Face-Mask-Detector-
Please read this README before running the code. You will find all information in order to run the code below. 

**About**
This is a project of Matthias BrÃ¼derlin (???), Daan Friese (???), Oleg Lukanin (oleg), Celia Vetter (Celia) and Joel Weibel (jowe).
The project was created for the course *Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages* at the University of St.Gallen.
The goal of the project was to create a mask detector based on an existing dataset. The programm uses machine learning with python.
The programm can say if somebody is wearing a face mask, either on a live video or on a recorded video and allows the user to save the video with the corresponding results.

**Pre-requisits**
This programm is written for Python. 
The following versions have been used to run it: 
1. Python 3.8 from anaconda
2. Pycharm Community Edition
3. Microsoft visual studios c++

Before running the code, please do the following: 
1. Download the folders "dataset" and "face_detector" as well as the document "requirements.txt" and safe it in a folder (e.g. mask detector programm) on your computer
2. Download the necessary packages: open anaconda prompt and (i) enter "cd" and copy paste your working directory to the document " requirements.txt" and then (ii) enter "pip install -r requirements.txt" in order to install the packages defined in the requirements document
3. Open Pycharm and change your working directory to the folder created in step 1 (click on the right top on your file name -> edit configurator -> change your script path)
4. Choose your python intepreter (click on the right top on your file name -> edit configurator -> choose anaconda as python intepreter)
5. Change your direction in the code "train_mask_detector.py" to the corresponding folder with the datasets (line 29)
6. Run the code "train_mask_detector.py" in order to train the model
7. Run the code "detect_mask_video.py" in order to use the trained programm

**Description**
*train_mask_detector.py*
This code uses the package tensorflow and will to the following: 
First, it loads the dataset which is seperated in pictures with mask and in pictures without mask.
Afterwards, it will train the face mask detector with the use of the labelled pictures. 
The programm saves our detector as "mask_detector.model" and creates a plot with the losses and the accruacy of our model.

*detect_mask_video.py*
In the second code, we first implement a face detection.
The model created in the other file is then loaded into our second programm.
Then, you can apply the trained program in the following two ways: it will give you the choice to either activate your camera and check if you are wearing a face mask or upload a video to which the mechanism is applied. It furthermore indicates the percentage of certainty whether it detects a face mask or not.
At the end, the user can choose if he wants to save the video or not.

**Sources**
This programm is based on the face mask detector by Balaji Srinivas https://github.com/balajisrinivas/Face-Mask-Detection. We also got our dataset from there. 
The programm has been enhanced with different functionalities. User input in order to choose if the face mask detector should use the webcam or a video has been added. Additionally, the user can choose to save the output.
